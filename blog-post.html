      You've been provided with a blog post as raw text, and you need to convert this post into a properly marked-up HTML file.

      The post should have a primary heading of Introducing AlgoCoin with a tagline of The future of decentralized meme currency is here..

      The post should be treated as an article with two sections, titled What is AlgoCoin and Where Do I Start?, respectively. Each section should have a paragraph of text (the text directly below the respective section title in the starting code), and the sections should be divided by a horizontal rule.

      In the first section, the text proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm should be marked up as strong text, and Web 4.0 should be emphasized. In the second section, the word AlgoExpert should be a link to https://algoexpert.io, and it should open in a new tab.

      Finally, the post should have a footer at the bottom with the text Copyright 3022 AlgoCoin. All rights reserved..

      Your HTML code should use proper semantic markup.

      Introducing AlgoCoin
      The future of decentralized meme currency is here.

      What is AlgoCoin?
      AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm
      that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the
      metaverse to its next major stage: Web 4.0. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of
      hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time
      of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree
      equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420
      AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.

      Where  Do I Start?
      Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We
      recommend starting out by practicing on AlgoExpert. Next, once you feel
      you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's
      time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future.
